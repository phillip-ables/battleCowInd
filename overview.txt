so you load up in a flying wagon, your horse and all
idk it rolls down a hill and hits a cliff off the grand canyon

in the air

also mics need to be activated
take everything that you can console into that phone and do it
dont ask just put it there if its a feature to a system that is just is
make them turn off the chat cus we making noise

im gonna hate some of these comments

in the air you have everyones screens in party already
so if you are linked up then you see the wind blowing all 8 players
and the horse
crazy shit, like youre skydiving,
once clicked to deploy you seem them jump and maybe a woo hoo
and then you land them at a quick pick,
map shows up in just enough time to pick how to land but not enought time to sit and wait

well i guess thats about it for this low poly phone battleroyal
